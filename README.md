With the development of the civil aviation transportation industry in recent years, the volume of civil aviation transportation has increased rapidly.Increased carrier costs  and reduced airport operating efficiency caused by flight delays  have become issues that need to be addressed. How to improve the accuracy of predicting flight arrival delay time is of great significance for improving airport transportation efficiency, rationally scheduling flights and improving passenger comfort. In this paper, the Cat-boost;an ensemble learning model is utilized on the U.S Domestic airline on-time performance data from U.S.Transportation Administration, combined with the characteristics of the model to determine the influencing factors,  to predict the arrival delays of flights within the United States. The accuracy; precision and  some other criterion of the model are given to evaluate the performance on the data. A better effect is obtained: the accuracy reach 80.44% in this case.
